              The Crypto Mars application runs on the Ethereum network and utilizes smart contracts with individual
              erc721 tokens (with each being known as a “Smart Contract”) to allow users to buy and own unique,
              one-of-a-kind colonies Smart Contracts.<br />
              <br />Throughout these Terms of Service, the Smart Contracts and the Site hosting the game will be known
              as the “Game”.<br />
              <br />By choosing to use the Game, users can purchase and own colonies Smart Contracts. Crypto Mars is
              making the Game available to you. Prior to using the Game, you must agree to these Terms of Service.<br />
              <br />Read the following Terms of Service carefully and thoroughly prior to using the Game, purchasing
              Smart Contracts, or using the Site. Unless we have a separate, written agreement with you that differs
              from the below Terms of Service, the following Terms of Service absolutely and unequivocally govern your
              use of the Site, purchase of Smart Contracts, and ownership of Smart Contracts. We will only allow you to
              use this Site, own Smart Contracts, and/or purchase Smart Contracts if you accept all of these Terms of
              Service.<br />
              <br />By using this Game, this Site, and/or these Smart Contracts, or by clicking “agree”, you confirm
              that you understand these Terms and accept these Terms. In the event that you are using this Site, this
              Game, or these Smart Contracts on behalf of another company or legal entity, you indicate that you have
              the legal authority to accept these Terms on the other party’s behalf, and that any mention of “you” in
              this contract means the other party that you represent. If you do not have the authority to represent
              another party, then you do not have permission to use this Game, this Site, or these Smart Contracts.<p>
                <br />
                <br />1. WE DO NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS<br />
                <br />Crypto Mars.io is a UI interface which allows you to interact directly with a blockcahin smart
                contract on the ethereum network using the “Metamask” browser extension. The website and it’s creators
                do not except or hold any payments from players. Any ether transfers done over the website’s are
                transferred directly to blockchain contract address: 0x92cB5F1FbabbcbDd891B9Cbd8E9a056c8c1eEbEF Any
                Ether or fiat currency deposited into your metamask extension is fully owned and controlled by the
                player. The game does not have access to the funds deposited in your metamask browser extension.
                Transfers of Ether, are passed directly from your metamask account to a smart contract on the ethereum
                network. Since the game does not except your deposits and does not have any control over it, the game
                and it’s creators are not liable for any damages or lost of funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. PLAY RESPONSIBLY<br />
                <br />This game allows you to buy and collect digital assets. There is no guarantee that other players
                or anyone else will buy these assets from you. While some players speculate about their ability to
                resell their digital assets for a higher value in the future, there is no guarantee that another person
                will decide to buy your digital asset. If you you choose to transfer ETH in exchange for the ERC721
                referred to in the game as “smart contract”, you must accept and understand the risk of potentially not
                being able to sell your “smart contract” in the future. The game is designed for collectors who choose
                to pay for the ownership of a digital product referred to as a “smart contracts”. If you choose to
                speculate over the future value and liquidity of your asset, you must do so at your own risk and not
                hold the creators of the game or the smart contract liable for any loss or damages. Play responsibly and
                do not spend more than you feel the digital asset is worth.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. SMART CONTRACTS<br />
                <br />We have used the name of countries to create unique, one-of-a-kind “Smart Contracts” which are
                represented by ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum BlockChain. These “Smart Contracts” are not endorsed or
                supported by the person appearing on the card. New colonies Smart Contracts will be released as we deem
                fit. Each colonies Smart Contract may be purchased by you utilizing ether. You may purchase any colonies
                Smart Contract you choose, and any other party may purchase a colonies Smart Contract that you currently
                own if the other party is willing to pay a higher sum. The price of the tokens are hard coded into the
                smart contract itself and can not be changed by anyone, including the games creators. You may not stop
                another party from purchasing a colonies Smart Contract that you currently own, and no other third party
                may stop you from purchasing a colonies Smart Contract that you wish to own. Whichever party is willing
                to pay the cost of the colonies Smart Contract may own said Smart Contract after he or she completes the
                transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. THE GAME<br />
                <br />This Game requires that you utilize a Google Chrome or Firefox web browser that currently has a
                MetaMask browser extension installed. MetaMask is an electronic wallet created by a third party that
                allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You may not use
                any other electronic wallet on the Game other than MetaMask; however, you can use other electronic
                wallets and third-party applications to transfer funds to your MetaMask wallet in order to make
                purchases and receive payment on the Game. If you do not log on to the Game with the correct browser
                (either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) and/or if the browser does not have the MetaMask extension
                installed, you will be recognized by the Game, but you will not be able to interact with the Game in any
                way. Any and all transactions that take place in the Game occur via the Ethereum blockchain. You
                understand that by using the Game, your Ethereum public address will be made visible to other users of
                the Game as well as third parties each and every time you engage in a transaction on the Game. We do not
                own and we do not control any of the following third-party products used for the function of this Game:
                MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or the Ethereum network. We do not own and we do not
                control any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit, or use for
                the purpose of interacting with or using the Game. We will not be held liable, and are not liable, for
                the acts or omissions by any such third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any
                damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned
                third parties. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an
                account to utilize the Game. You are solely responsible for the safety and security of your MetaMask
                wallet and/or any other electronic wallet you utilize to interact with the Game. You are solely
                responsible for the safety and security of your account with us. If you become aware of security breach
                in regards to your password or your account, you agree to notify us immediately upon discovery at
                hello@Crypto Mars.io.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. FEES AND PAYMENTS<br />
                <br />If you choose to purchase any colonies Smart Contract” on the Game, any and all transactions will
                be conducted through the Ethereum network utilizing a MetaMask electronic wallet directly to a Smart
                Contract on the blockchain, which is not controlled by the games creators. We will not have any insight
                into or control over these payments or transactions, nor will we be able to reverse any transaction that
                occurs. Because of this, we will have no liability to you or any other third party for any claims or
                damages that may occur due to any transaction that takes place on the Game and/or in regards to any of
                the colonies Smart Contracts that we have created. The Ethereum network requires that you pay a
                transaction fee, commonly known as “Gas”, for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. Gas
                is intended to fund the hardware and software that runs the Ethereum network, as well as to prevent
                misuse and spam. If you choose to interact with the Game via our Site or without using the Game or our
                Site as a portal, you will still need to pay fee for any and every transaction you make on the Ethereum
                network. The smart contract keeps a 1-5% commission fee on every transaction conducted through it, in
                addition to the Gas charged by the Ethereum network. The creators of this website and game do not have
                access or control over these fees, as it is handled directly on the distributed blockcahin network. WE
                DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENTS DIRECTLY ON OUR WEBSITE.

                third-party beneficiaries to these terms; any third party is an independent contractor, and these Terms
                do not form any agency, partnership, or joint venture. You understand and agree that the language in
                these terms should and will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any
                party. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written
                consent from us. However, we may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms to an affiliate or
                in connection with an acquisition, sale, or merger at our sole discretion. In the event that any part of
                these Terms be deemed invalid or unenforceable by proper legal authorities, that portion will be struck
                while the remaining portions remain in full force and effect. Any potential failure on our part to
                enforce these Terms is not and will not be deemed a waiver of these Terms, in part or in whole. Any
                legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be handled by the courts in Hong Kong, and the
                parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there. Finally, we are not liable and
                will not be held liable for any failure or delay in performance of our obligation under these Terms that
                result from any condition beyond our control. This includes government action, acts of terrorism,
                earthquakes, floods, fire, power failures, internet disturbances, or acts of omission by any third
                party. You agree that we may provide you with a notice of any changes to these Terms by email, regular
                mail, or by posting on the Game or the Site. By providing us with your email address, you consent to
                forgo receiving any notices via postal mail.
